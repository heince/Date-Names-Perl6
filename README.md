Date::Names
===========

Module **Date::Names** - Provides month and day-of-the-week names for numbers (multilingual)

SYNOPSIS
========

## IMPORTANT NOTE: the modules hashes are no longer exported in order
## to avoid interference with the user's environment.

~~~perl6
use Date::Names;

# For one-off use
say "Month 3 in Dutch is '{%Date::Names::mon<nl><3>}'";
say "Month 3 in English is '{%Date::Names::mon<3>}' or '{%Date::Names::mon<en><3>}'";
say "Month 3 in French is '{%Date::Names::mon<fr><3>}'";
say "Weekday 3 in Italian is '{%Date::Names::dow<it><3>}'";
say "Weekday 3 in Spanish is '{%Date::Names::dow<it><3>}'";
say "Two-letter abbrev. of weekday 3 in German is '{%Date::Names::dow2<de><3>}'";
say "Three-letter abbrev. of weekday 3 in English is '{%Date::Names::dow3<en><3>}'";

# For more intense cases, one can use this syntax:
my %dow = %Date::Names::dow<nl>; # a convenience hash
say "Weekdays in Dutch:";
for 1..7 -> $n {
    say "  day $n: {%dow{$n}}";
}
~~~


DESCRIPTION
===========

Module **Date::Names** provides the full name of months and days of the week for
the numbers 1..12 and 1..7, respectively, primarily for use with
**Perl 6**'s date functions.

Full names of the months and weekdays are currently available in the
following languages:

  Language | ISO two-letter code
  ---      | :---:
  Dutch    | nl
  English  | en
  French   | fr
  German   | de
  Italian  | it
  Norwegian (Bokmål) | nb
  Russian  | ru
  Spanish  | es

CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION
==============================

All English month and weekday names are always capitalized.
Other languages vary in capitalization depending on where
the word or abbreviation is used or other factors. The
names and abbreviations herein are in the most common form,
but the user can always explicitly set the case by applying
the Perl 6 routines **tc**, **uc**, or **lc** to the name or
abbreviation.

None of the abbreviations include an ending period even though
that might be customary use in some languages.

LIMITATIONS
===========

Not all languages have a complete set of two- and three-letter
abbreviations, and some require up to four letters for the official
abbreviations.

The following table shows the hash names for the abbreviations
currently available. Hash names with a 2 or 3 appended are complete
abbreviation sets of that length only.  Hash names with an 'a'
appended are sets of abbreviations of mixed length.  A 'Y' in a cell
indicates a language has a complete set of that type of abbreviation.

Note that in some countries the term "abbreviation" is distinctly
different than "code" as applies to date names. An asterisk in a cell
marks those which are technically codes rater than abbreviations.

Language | %mon2 | %mon3 | %mona | %dow2 | %dow3 | %dowa
---      | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Dutch    |       |       |       |       |       |
English  |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |   Y   |
French   |   Y*  |       |   Y   |       |   Y   |   Y
German   |       |   Y   |       |       |       |
Italian  |       |       |       |       |       |
Norwegian|       |       |       |       |       |
Russian  |       |   Y   |       |       |       |   Y
Spanish  |       |   Y*  |       |       |   Y*  |
